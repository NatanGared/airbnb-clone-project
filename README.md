booking_id: Foreign key linking to the associated booking.
amount: Total amount paid.
payment_date: Date of the payment transaction.
status: Status of the payment (e.g., completed, pending).

**Entity Relationships**
User ↔ Property: A user can own multiple properties (one-to-many).
User ↔ Booking: A user can have multiple bookings (one-to-many).
Property ↔ Booking: A booking belongs to one property, but a property can have multiple bookings (one-to-many).
User ↔ Review: A user can write multiple reviews (one-to-many).
Property ↔ Review: A property can have multiple reviews (one-to-many).
Booking ↔ Payment: A payment is associated with one booking (one-to-one).

**Feature Breakdown**
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

**API Security**

**Key Security Measures**
***Authentication***
Description: Users must verify their identity using secure methods (e.g., email/password, JWT tokens).
Importance: Ensures that only authorized users can access their accounts and personal information, protecting against unauthorized access.

***Authorization***
Description: Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles (e.g., guest vs. host).
Importance: Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they are not permitted to, ensuring data integrity and security.

***Rate Limiting***
Description: Limits the number of requests a user can make to the API in a given time frame.
Importance: Protects against abuse and denial-of-service attacks by preventing excessive requests from a single user.

***Data Encryption***
Description: Sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information, will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.
Importance: Protects user data from interception and unauthorized access, ensuring confidentiality.

***Input Validation and Sanitization***
Description: All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
Importance: Reduces the risk of malicious input compromising the application or database.

**Security Importance by Key Area**
***User Authentication***
Crucial for: Protecting user accounts and personal information from unauthorized access. A breach can lead to identity theft or misuse of user data.

***Property Management***
Crucial for: Securing sensitive data related to property listings. Unauthorized access can lead to data manipulation or fraudulent listings.

***Booking System***
Crucial for: Ensuring the integrity of booking data. Unauthorized changes can disrupt bookings, leading to user dissatisfaction and financial loss.

***Payment Processing***
Crucial for: Protecting payment information during transactions. Security breaches can result in financial theft and loss of user trust.

***Review System***
Crucial for: Maintaining the authenticity of reviews. Fake reviews can mislead users and damage the reputation of legitimate properties.

***Database Optimizations***
Crucial for: Ensuring efficient and secure access to data. Poorly optimized databases can lead to vulnerabilities and performance issues, making them easier targets for attacks.

**CI/CD Pipeline**

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines are automated processes that facilitate the integration of code changes and the deployment of applications.
Continuous Integration (CI): Involves automatically testing and integrating code changes into a shared repository. This ensures that code changes are validated and do not break the existing application.
Continuous Deployment (CD): Automates the release of software updates to production environments after passing all tests, allowing new features and fixes to be delivered quickly and reliably.

***Importance for the Project***

Faster Development Cycle: Automates testing and deployment, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than manual processes.
Early Bug Detection: CI helps identify integration issues early, reducing the cost and time needed to resolve them.
Consistent Deployments: CD ensures that deployments are reproducible and consistent, minimizing the risk of errors during release.
Improved Collaboration: Facilitates collaboration among team members by providing a clear process for integrating and deploying code changes.

***Tools for CI/CD***

GitHub Actions: Automates workflows directly from GitHub, allowing for seamless integration and deployment processes.
Docker: Used to containerize applications, ensuring consistency across different environments during testing and deployment.
Jenkins: An open-source automation server that supports building, deploying, and automating software development processes.
Travis CI: A cloud-based CI service that integrates with GitHub repositories, providing automated testing and deployment.
CircleCI: A CI/CD tool that automates the integration and delivery pipeline, easily integrating with various version control systems.
