User Authentication: Enable secure sign-up and login for users.
Property Listings: Allow hosts to create and manage property listings with detailed descriptions, images, and pricing.
Search and Filter: Implement search functionality for users to find listings based on location, price, and amenities.
Booking System: Facilitate booking processes, including date selection and payment integration.
User Reviews: Enable users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

User ↔ Review: A user can write multiple reviews (one-to-many).
Property ↔ Review: A property can have multiple reviews (one-to-many).
Booking ↔ Payment: A payment is associated with one booking (one-to-one).

**Feature breakdowm**
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

**API Security**

**Key Security Measures**
***Authentication***
Description: Users must verify their identity using secure methods (e.g., email/password, JWT tokens).
Importance: Ensures that only authorized users can access their accounts and personal information, protecting against unauthorized access.

***Authorization***
Description: Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles (e.g., guest vs. host).
Importance: Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they are not permitted to, ensuring data integrity and security.

***Rate Limiting***
Description: Limits the number of requests a user can make to the API in a given time frame.
Importance: Protects against abuse and denial-of-service attacks by preventing excessive requests from a single user.

***Data Encryption***
Description: Sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information, will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.
Importance: Protects user data from interception and unauthorized access, ensuring confidentiality.

***Input Validation and Sanitization***
Description: All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
Importance: Reduces the risk of malicious input compromising the application or database.

**Security Importance by Key Area**
***User Authentication***
Crucial for: Protecting user accounts and personal information from unauthorized access. A breach can lead to identity theft or misuse of user data.

***Property Management***
Crucial for: Securing sensitive data related to property listings. Unauthorized access can lead to data manipulation or fraudulent listings.

***Booking System***
Crucial for: Ensuring the integrity of booking data. Unauthorized changes can disrupt bookings, leading to user dissatisfaction and financial loss.

***Payment Processing***
Crucial for: Protecting payment information during transactions. Security breaches can result in financial theft and loss of user trust.

***Review System***
Crucial for: Maintaining the authenticity of reviews. Fake reviews can mislead users and damage the reputation of legitimate properties.

***Database Optimizations***
Crucial for: Ensuring efficient and secure access to data. Poorly optimized databases can lead to vulnerabilities and performance issues, making them easier targets for attacks.
